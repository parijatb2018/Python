Python Coding
This ipynb file includes codes for the following games:
- Tic-Tac-Toe
- Hangman
- Cows and Bulls
- Rock-Paper-Scissors
and other codes, namely Web Scrapping, and Log parsing.

I have developed an algorithm for the Cows and Bulls game, where 
the computer can find upto 9 digit number by asking number of cows and 
bulls after each guess.
